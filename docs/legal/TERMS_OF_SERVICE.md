## 4. How Adify Works

### 4.1 Platform Overview

Adify operates as a rewards-based advertising platform that connects users with advertisers through Google AdMob integration. The Platform generates revenue through advertisements displayed to users, and a portion of this revenue is distributed to users in the form of AdCoins based on their engagement activities.

### 4.2 The AdCoins System

AdCoins serve as the Platform's virtual currency and primary unit for tracking user earnings. Users accumulate AdCoins through various activities, and these coins can be converted to Cash Balance for withdrawal:

- **Virtual Currency:** AdCoins have no independent monetary value and cannot be transferred, sold, or exchanged outside the Platform
- **Earning Mechanism:** AdCoins are awarded based on completed activities as detailed in Section 5
- **Conversion Process:** AdCoins in your balance are automatically valued for Cash Balance calculation based on current conversion rates and regional multipliers
- **Non-Refundable:** Once earned and converted, AdCoins and Cash Balance are non-refundable except as required by applicable law

### 4.3 Revenue Distribution Model

The Platform operates on a revenue-sharing model:

1. **Advertising Revenue:** Generated primarily through Google AdMob when users view advertisements
2. **Platform Fee:** The Company retains a percentage to cover operational costs, development, fraud prevention, payment processing, and profit
3. **User Distribution:** The remaining portion is distributed to users as AdCoins based on their engagement

### 4.4 Conversion Rates

Conversion rates between AdCoins and real currency (USD) are determined by:

- Base advertising revenue generated per impression
- Regional Rate Multipliers (Section 6)
- Platform operational costs
- Payment processing fees
- Currency exchange rates (for non-USD transactions)

Conversion rates are dynamic and may change based on these factors. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of significant changes to conversion rates.

### 4.5 Account Dashboard

Your account dashboard provides real-time information about:
- Total AdCoins balance
- Current Cash Balance equivalent
- Earnings history
- Withdrawal history
- Referral statistics
- Account status and tier

## 5. Earning Mechanics

### 5.1 Video Advertisement Viewing

Users can earn AdCoins by viewing video advertisements through Google AdMob:

- **Engagement Requirement:** Users must watch videos to completion to receive credit
- **Availability:** Video advertisements are subject to availability from AdMob and may vary by region
- **Earnings Calculation:** AdCoins earned per video are calculated based on the advertising revenue generated and applicable Regional Rate Multiplier
- **Fair Use:** Excessive or automated video viewing may be flagged by our fraud detection systems

### 5.2 Interactive Games

Users can earn AdCoins by playing advertisement-supported games:

- **Game Library:** Access to games is provided through the Platform's integrated game feature
- **Reward Structure:** Games award AdCoins based on gameplay duration and advertisement interactions
- **Performance Metrics:** Some games may award bonus AdCoins for achieving specific milestones or high scores
- **Integrity:** Use of game cheats, hacks, or exploits will result in account termination

### 5.3 Referral Program

Users can earn AdCoins by referring new users to the Platform:

- **Referral Mechanism:** Each user receives a unique referral code or link
- **Qualification Requirements:** Referred users must create a valid account and meet minimum engagement thresholds
- **Referral Rewards:** Referrers earn a specified number of AdCoins when their referrals complete qualifying activities

- See Section 8 for complete Elite Subscription details

## 6. Regional Rate Multipliers

### 6.1 Purpose and Rationale

Regional Rate Multipliers exist to reflect the reality that advertising revenue varies significantly across different geographic markets. Advertisers pay different rates for impressions and clicks based on the purchasing power, market size, and competitive landscape of each region. To maintain platform sustainability while providing fair compensation, Adify applies multipliers that correlate with the actual revenue generated from each country.

### 6.2 Multiplier Ranges

Regional Rate Multipliers range from **0.8x to 1.2x** and are applied to base AdCoin earning rates:

- **Tier 1 Markets (1.2x multiplier):** Countries with highest advertising CPM rates, typically including United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other high-value advertising markets
- **Tier 2 Markets (1.0x multiplier):** Countries with moderate advertising CPM rates, including many European, Asian, and South American markets
- **Tier 3 Markets (0.8x multiplier):** Countries with lower advertising CPM rates, often due to smaller market size or lower advertiser competition

### 6.3 Multiplier Determination

Your Regional Rate Multiplier is determined by:

- **IP Address Location:** Primary method for determining geographic location
- **Account Registration Country:** Country specified during account creation
- **Payment Method Location:** Geographic location associated with your PayPal account
- **Consistency Verification:** Our systems verify that these indicators are consistent to prevent location manipulation

### 6.4 Prohibited Location Manipulation

The following activities related to location manipulation are strictly prohibited:

- Use of VPN services to misrepresent geographic location
- Use of proxy servers to access higher-multiplier regions
- GPS spoofing or location falsification
- Account registration using false address information
- Any other attempt to circumvent Regional Rate Multipliers

Violation of these prohibitions will result in immediate account termination and forfeiture of all balances.

### 6.5 Multiplier Changes

Regional Rate Multipliers may be updated periodically to reflect:

- Changes in advertising market conditions
- Currency exchange rate fluctuations
- New market data from AdMob
- Platform economic adjustments

Users will be notified of material changes to their Regional Rate Multiplier through in-app notifications and email.

### 6.6 Transparency

Your current Regional Rate Multiplier is displayed in your account dashboard. We provide this transparency to ensure users understand how their earnings are calculated.

## 7. Withdrawal Terms

### 7.1 Minimum Withdrawal Threshold

To request a withdrawal, you must have accumulated a minimum Cash Balance equivalent to **15,000 AdCoins**. This threshold exists to:

- Minimize transaction fees relative to withdrawal amounts

### 7.2 Payment Method

Currently, **PayPal is the only supported payment method** for withdrawals:

We may add additional payment methods in the future, which will be announced through the Platform.

### 7.3 Processing Time

Withdrawal requests are processed within **7-14 business days** from the date of request submission:

- **Review Period (3-5 business days):** All withdrawal requests undergo fraud detection review and verification
- **Processing Period (2-5 business days):** Approved withdrawals are prepared for payment transfer

Processing times may be extended during high-volume periods, technical issues, or when additional verification is required.

### 7.4 Verification Requirements

Before processing withdrawals, we may require:

- **Identity Verification:** Government-issued ID to confirm your identity

The following limits apply to withdrawals:

### 7.7 Rejected Withdrawals

Withdrawal requests may be rejected for reasons including but not limited to:

- Fraudulent account activity

- Insufficient account age or activity history

If your withdrawal is rejected, you will be notified via email with the reason for rejection. Rejected withdrawals return the AdCoins to your account balance, unless the rejection is due to fraud or Terms violations, in which case balance forfeiture may occur.

### 7.8 Irreversible Transactions

Once a withdrawal is processed and funds are transferred to your PayPal account, the transaction is generally irreversible. You are responsible for ensuring your PayPal information is correct before submitting a withdrawal request.
