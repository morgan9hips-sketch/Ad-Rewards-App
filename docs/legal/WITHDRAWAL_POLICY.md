# Withdrawal Policy

**Effective Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Withdrawal Policy ("Policy") governs the withdrawal of earned funds from the Adify Platform operated by AdRev Technologies (Pty) Ltd ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). This Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and all other applicable policies.

By requesting a withdrawal from your Adify account, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to abide by the terms and conditions set forth in this Policy.

**Important:** Withdrawals are a privilege, not a guaranteed right. We reserve the right to deny, delay, or reverse withdrawals that violate our policies or appear fraudulent.

## 2. Withdrawal Eligibility

### 2.1 Account Requirements

To be eligible for withdrawals, your account must:

**Meet Basic Requirements:**

- Be in good standing (not suspended or under investigation)
- Comply with all Terms of Service
- Have completed any required identity verification

**Account Age:**
- Account must be at least 7 days old from registration date
- This requirement prevents fraudulent accounts from immediately withdrawing
- Applies only to the first withdrawal; subsequent withdrawals have no age requirement

**Activity Requirements:**

- Patterns suggesting fraud or abuse may delay or disqualify withdrawals

### 2.3 Geographic Restrictions

**Supported Countries:**

**Restricted Countries:**
- Countries subject to international sanctions
- Countries where PayPal doesn't operate
- Countries where local regulations prohibit our service

**Verification:** We verify that your account location, IP address, and PayPal account location are consistent. Mismatched locations may trigger additional verification or withdrawal denial.

## 3. Minimum Withdrawal Threshold

### 3.1 Threshold Amount

**Minimum Requirement: 15,000 AdCoins Cash Balance**

You must accumulate at least 15,000 AdCoins converted to Cash Balance before you can request a withdrawal.

**Rationale:**
- **Transaction Costs:** Minimizes payment processing costs relative to payout amounts
- **Fraud Prevention:** Reduces incentive for small-scale fraud attempts
- **Platform Sustainability:** Ensures economic viability of the platform
- **User Benefit:** Provides meaningful payout amounts worth the processing time

### 3.2 Cash Balance Calculation

**AdCoins vs. Cash Balance:**
- **AdCoins:** Virtual currency earned through Platform activities
- **Cash Balance:** Monetary value of AdCoins calculated using current conversion rates and Regional Rate Multipliers
- **Threshold Applies To:** Cash Balance equivalent to 15,000 AdCoins

**Example:**
- Base conversion: 1,000 AdCoins = $1.00 USD
- Regional Rate Multiplier: 1.0x (Tier 2 country)
- 15,000 AdCoins = $15.00 USD Cash Balance (meets threshold)

**Regional Variations:**
Due to Regional Rate Multipliers (0.8x to 1.2x), the actual cash value of 15,000 AdCoins varies by country:
- **Tier 1 (1.2x multiplier):** 15,000 AdCoins ≈ $18.00 USD
- **Tier 2 (1.0x multiplier):** 15,000 AdCoins ≈ $15.00 USD
- **Tier 3 (0.8x multiplier):** 15,000 AdCoins ≈ $12.00 USD

**Note:** Exact values depend on current conversion rates, which may fluctuate.

### 3.3 Below-Threshold Balances

If your Cash Balance is below 15,000 AdCoins:

- You cannot request a withdrawal
- Continue earning AdCoins through Platform activities
- Balance is retained safely in your account
- No expiration if you remain active (see Balance Expiry policy in Terms of Service)

### 3.4 No Minimum for Account Closure

**Exception:** If you choose to close your account entirely, you forfeit any balance below the minimum withdrawal threshold. We do not make exceptions for below-threshold withdrawals, even for account closures.

**Recommendation:** Reach the minimum threshold before closing your account to avoid forfeiting earned funds.

## 4. Payment Method

### 4.1 PayPal Only

**Current Payment Method:** PayPal is the **only** supported payment method for withdrawals from Adify.

## 8. Regional Rate Multipliers

### 8.1 Overview

**Regional Rate Multipliers** adjust AdCoin earning rates based on the advertising revenue generated from your country. Multipliers range from **0.8x to 1.2x** and directly impact the cash value of your AdCoins.

**Purpose:**
- Reflect actual advertising revenue by country (CPM rates vary globally)
- Ensure platform sustainability
- Provide fair compensation proportional to revenue generated

### 8.2 Multiplier Tiers

**Tier 1: High-Value Markets (1.2x multiplier)**
- Countries: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, etc.
- Characteristics: High advertising CPM rates, strong purchasing power, competitive ad markets
- Effect: 15,000 AdCoins ≈ $18.00 USD Cash Balance

**Tier 2: Moderate-Value Markets (1.0x multiplier)**
- Countries: Most European countries, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, many South American countries, South Africa, etc.
- Characteristics: Moderate advertising CPM rates, established digital ad markets
- Effect: 15,000 AdCoins ≈ $15.00 USD Cash Balance

**Tier 3: Developing Markets (0.8x multiplier)**
- Countries: Many Asian, African, Eastern European, and Latin American countries
- Characteristics: Lower advertising CPM rates, smaller ad markets, developing economies
- Effect: 15,000 AdCoins ≈ $12.00 USD Cash Balance

**Note:** Specific country classifications may change over time based on market data.

### 8.3 How Multipliers Are Determined

**Data Sources:**
- Google AdMob revenue data by country
- Historical CPM (cost per thousand impressions) rates
- Currency exchange rates
- Market size and competition

**Updates:**
- Multipliers reviewed quarterly
- Adjusted based on actual advertising revenue trends
- Users notified of material changes (see Terms of Service)

### 8.4 Location Verification

**Your Multiplier Is Based On:**
1. **Account Registration Country:** Country selected during signup
2. **IP Address:** Current and historical IP addresses
3. **PayPal Account Location:** Country of your PayPal account

**Consistency Required:**
All three indicators should align. Mismatched locations trigger additional verification or withdrawal denial.

**Examples of Mismatches:**
- Account registered in US, but IP address consistently shows India
- PayPal account in UK, but account registered in Nigeria
- IP addresses from multiple countries (possible VPN use)

### 8.5 Prohibited Multiplier Manipulation

**Strictly Forbidden:**
- **VPN Use:** Using VPNs to appear in higher-multiplier countries
- **Proxy Servers:** Routing traffic through proxies to fake location
- **GPS Spoofing:** Falsifying GPS location (if location permissions were granted)
- **False Registration:** Registering with false country information

**Detection:**
- Our fraud detection systems identify VPN/proxy usage
- Device fingerprinting detects location inconsistencies
- AdMob data cross-referenced with account location

**Consequences:**
- Immediate account termination
- Forfeiture of all AdCoins and Cash Balance
- Ban on creating future accounts
- No warnings or appeals for blatant manipulation

### 8.6 Traveling and Moving

**Legitimate Location Changes:**

**Traveling:**
- Temporary travel to other countries is acceptable
- Short-term IP address changes from travel do not affect multiplier
- Your multiplier remains based on account registration country
- Extended travel (several months) may trigger verification

**Permanent Relocation:**
- If you move to a different country, contact support@adrevtechnologies.co.za
- Provide proof of relocation (new address verification)
- Account location and multiplier will be updated after verification
- PayPal account should also be updated to new country
