# Subscription Terms

**Effective Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026

## 1. Introduction

These Subscription Terms ("Terms") govern your subscription to Adify Elite, the premium tier of the Adify Platform operated by AdRev Technologies (Pty) Ltd ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By subscribing to Adify Elite, you agree to these Subscription Terms in addition to our general Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and all other applicable policies.

**Important:** Please read these Terms carefully before subscribing. These Terms include important information about billing, renewals, cancellations, and refunds.

## 2. Subscription Overview

### 2.1 Adify Elite Subscription

**Adify Elite** is a premium subscription tier that provides enhanced benefits and an improved user experience on the Adify Platform. Elite is an optional upgrade from the Free Tier and offers significant advantages to users who prefer an ad-free experience.

### 2.2 Subscription Nature

- **Optional:** Subscription to Elite is entirely voluntary; the Platform remains usable on the Free Tier
- **Recurring:** Elite subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless canceled
- **Paid Service:** Requires payment via supported payment methods
- **Non-Essential:** Elite benefits are enhancements, not requirements for basic Platform functionality

- No forced video advertisement viewing
- No interstitial advertisements
- No banner advertisements
- Clean, uncluttered interface

- Guarantee higher AdCoin earning rates (earnings are based on activity and Regional Rate Multipliers)
- Provide different conversion rates for withdrawals

- Bypass minimum withdrawal thresholds (15,000 AdCoins still required)
- Change Regional Rate Multipliers (these remain based on your country)
