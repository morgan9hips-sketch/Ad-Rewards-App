# Google AdMob Disclosure

**Effective Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This disclosure provides transparent information about how AdRev Technologies (Pty) Ltd ("we," "us," or "our") uses Google AdMob in the Adify Platform and how this integration affects your privacy and user experience. This document should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy.

**Important:** Google AdMob is a critical component of the Adify business model. Advertising revenue generated through AdMob enables us to offer the free tier of our service and reward users with AdCoins. By using the Adify Platform, you acknowledge and accept the integration of Google AdMob as described in this disclosure.

## 2. What is Google AdMob?

### 2.1 Overview

**Google AdMob** is Google's mobile advertising platform that connects app developers with advertisers. AdMob delivers advertisements within mobile applications and enables developers to monetize their apps through ad revenue.

**Key Components:**
- Ad delivery network
- Ad mediation platform
- Analytics and reporting tools
- Revenue optimization technology
- Multiple ad format support

### 2.2 AdMob in Adify

Adify integrates Google AdMob to:

- Display advertisements to Free Tier users
- Generate revenue from ad impressions and clicks
- Distribute a portion of advertising revenue to users as AdCoins
- Provide various ad formats (video ads, rewarded ads, interstitial ads)
- Enable users to earn rewards by engaging with advertisements

**Business Model:** The Adify Platform operates on a revenue-sharing model where advertising revenue from AdMob is split between:
- Platform operational costs and profit
- User earnings (AdCoins)
- Payment processing and infrastructure

### 2.3 Google's Role

**Google acts as:**
- **Ad Network:** Connecting advertisers with Adify's user base
- **Data Processor:** Collecting and processing data for ad targeting
- **Payment Processor:** Paying advertising revenue to us (we then pay users)
- **Technology Provider:** Supplying ad delivery infrastructure

**Important Distinction:** Google is not just a service provider to us; they also have a direct relationship with you as a user through their advertising ecosystem.

## 3. Data Collected by Google AdMob

Google AdMob collects various types of data when you use Adify. This data collection is governed primarily by Google's Privacy Policy, though we are required to disclose it to you.

### 3.1 Advertising Identifiers

**Google Advertising ID (GAID) - Android Devices:**
- **What It Is:** A unique, user-resettable identifier for advertising purposes assigned by Google Play Services
- **Purpose:** Enables personalized advertising and ad tracking across apps
- **Control:** You can reset or disable this ID in device settings (Settings → Google → Ads → Reset advertising ID)
- **Opt-Out:** You can opt out of personalized ads (Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization)

**Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) - iOS Devices:**
- **What It Is:** Apple's advertising identifier
- **Purpose:** Ad tracking and personalization on iOS devices
- **Control:** On iOS 14.5+, apps must request permission to track (we request this permission to show relevant ads)
- **Opt-Out:** Settings → Privacy → Tracking → Ask App Not to Track

**Important:** These identifiers allow advertisers to:
- Track ad performance across multiple apps
- Build advertising profiles
- Deliver targeted advertisements
- Measure attribution (which ad led to which action)

### 3.2 Device Information

AdMob collects technical device data:

**Device Identifiers:**
- Device ID or hardware ID
- Device model and manufacturer
- Operating system and version
- Screen size and resolution

**Network Information:**
- IP address (which reveals approximate location)
- Mobile network operator
- Connection type (WiFi, cellular)
- Network performance data

**App Information:**
- App package name (com.adify.rewards)
- App version
- SDK version

**Purpose:**
- Ensuring ad compatibility with device
- Optimizing ad delivery
- Detecting fraud
- Technical troubleshooting

### 3.3 Location Data

**Country and City-Level Location:**
- **Collection Method:** Derived from IP address
- **Precision:** City or metropolitan area, not precise GPS coordinates
- **Purpose:** 
  - Delivering geographically relevant ads
  - Determining advertising rates (CPM varies by country)
  - Regional Rate Multiplier calculation for Adify

**Important:** AdMob does NOT collect precise GPS location through Adify (we do not request location permissions). However, approximate location is inferred from IP address.

**Privacy Note:** This differs from our Platform's location use. We only use country-level location for Regional Rate Multipliers, but AdMob may use city-level location for ad targeting.

### 3.4 Ad Interaction Data

AdMob tracks how you interact with advertisements:

**Impression Data:**
- Which ads were displayed
- When ads were shown
- How long ads were visible
- Whether ads were viewable (on screen)

**Engagement Data:**
- Ad clicks
- Video ad completions
- Interactive ad engagement
- Ad dismissals or skips

**Conversion Data:**
- Whether ad led to app install
- Whether ad led to purchase
- Post-click user behavior
- Attribution data

**Purpose:**
- Measuring ad effectiveness
- Optimizing ad delivery
- Calculating advertiser charges
- Determining Adify/user revenue share

### 3.5 Inferred Demographic and Interest Data

Google may infer information about you based on your advertising ID activity:

**Demographics:**
- Age range (not exact age)
- Gender
- Parental status (inferred)

**Interests:**
- Interest categories (sports, technology, shopping, etc.)
- Affinity audiences (users with sustained interest in topics)
- In-market audiences (users researching products/services)

**Important:** This data is **inferred** by Google's algorithms based on your broader online activity, not explicitly provided by Adify. We do not provide this information to Google.

**How It's Used:**
- Serving more relevant ads
- Increasing ad engagement rates
- Higher revenue for advertisers (and thus Adify and users)

### 3.6 Cross-App and Cross-Site Tracking

**Advertising Ecosystem Tracking:**
- AdMob is part of Google's broader advertising network
- Your advertising ID may be tracked across:
  - Multiple apps using AdMob
  - Websites using Google Ads
  - Other Google advertising products
- Google builds an advertising profile across these platforms

**Implications:**
- Ads in Adify may be influenced by your activity in other apps
- Your activity in Adify may influence ads in other apps
- Google's advertising ecosystem is interconnected

**Control:** You can limit cross-app tracking through device settings and Google Ad Settings.

### 3.7 Analytics Data

AdMob includes analytics functionality:

**User Behavior Analytics:**
- Session duration
- Screen views within ad flows
- User engagement patterns
- Cohort analysis
- Retention metrics

**Ad Performance Analytics:**
- eCPM (effective cost per thousand impressions)
- Fill rates (how often ad requests are filled)
- Click-through rates (CTR)
- Viewability rates

**Purpose:** Helping us optimize ad placement and user experience.

## 4. How Google Uses AdMob Data

### 4.3 Sharing with Advertisers

**Aggregate Reporting:**
- Advertisers receive reports on ad performance (impressions, clicks, conversions)
- Reports are aggregated and anonymized
- Individual users are not identified

**Audience Insights:**
- Advertisers learn about audience demographics and interests
- Data is provided in aggregate, not individual level

**Attribution:**

- Log data: Varies, but typically 18 months for ad serving logs
- Aggregate data: May be retained indefinitely

**Note:** We do not control Google's data retention. Review Google's Privacy Policy for their retention practices.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices Regarding AdMob

### 5.1 Opt-Out of Personalized Ads

**Android Devices:**
1. Go to Settings → Google → Ads
2. Toggle "Opt out of Ads Personalization"
3. **Effect:** You'll still see ads, but they won't be based on your interests

**iOS Devices:**
1. Go to Settings → Privacy → Tracking
2. Toggle off "Allow Apps to Request to Track"
3. Or decline tracking when Adify requests permission
4. **Effect:** Limits cross-app tracking and personalized ads

**Google Ad Settings (All Platforms):**
1. Visit https://www.google.com/settings/ads
2. Sign in to your Google Account
3. Toggle off "Ads Personalization"
4. Manage ad topics and advertisers

**Important:** Opting out reduces ad personalization but:
- Does **not** reduce the number of ads shown (Free Tier users still see ads)
- May result in less relevant, less engaging ads
- May reduce AdCoins earned if ads are less relevant
- Does **not** prevent all data collection (device data, ad impressions, etc. are still collected)

### 5.2 Reset Advertising ID

**Android:**
1. Settings → Google → Ads → Reset advertising ID
2. **Effect:** Creates a new advertising ID, breaking connection to previous ad profile

**iOS:**
1. Settings → Privacy → Advertising → Reset Advertising Identifier
2. **Effect:** Resets IDFA, limiting tracking continuity

**When to Reset:**
- If you want to start fresh with ad targeting
- If you feel ads are too personalized
- Periodically for privacy maintenance

### 5.3 Limit Ad Tracking (iOS - Pre-iOS 14.5)

On older iOS versions:
1. Settings → Privacy → Advertising → Limit Ad Tracking (toggle on)
2. **Effect:** Requests that apps don't use IDFA for tracking

**Note:** On iOS 14.5+, this is replaced by App Tracking Transparency framework, which requires explicit permission.
