# PRODUCTION POLICY: NO MOCK DATA

## ABSOLUTE RULES

1. **NEVER** use mock, fake, dummy, placeholder, or test data in production code
2. **NEVER** create mock API endpoints
3. **NEVER** return hardcoded fake responses
4. **ALWAYS** use real Prisma database queries
5. **ALWAYS** use real Supabase authentication
6. **ALWAYS** use real environment variables

## The ONLY Exception
- AdMob test ad unit IDs during development (must be replaced with real IDs before deployment)

## Consequences
Mock data in production has caused:
- Business failure
- Investor loss
- 7 days of debugging fake systems
- Millions in lost opportunity

**THIS MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.**
